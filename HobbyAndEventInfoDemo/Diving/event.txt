Description: USA Diving is a not-for-profit organization that continues to take the sport of diving and its athletes of all ages to new levels. We¡¯re passionate about sharing the excitement of the sport with new fans, and thanks to the support of a dedicated staff and other partner organizations, diving continues to be the United States¡¯ most successful summer Olympic sport.

We select, condition, and train teams to represent the United States in major diving events including the Olympic Games, World Championships, and the FINA Diving World Cup. Other well-known events include the USA Diving National Championships.

Many of our athletes begin diving as youths in our junior programs conducted through more than 200 clubs nationwide.

And our masters program supports those who no longer compete at the senior level, but wish to continue diving well into adulthood.

USA Diving is also a resource for guidance and information regarding all aspects of the sport. Connection through our membership gives coaches, divers, and fans access to the latest diving programs, events, news, and more. USA Diving members experience the excitement of diving at every level.
